    <h1>Word and Letter Spacing</h1>

    <article>
      <h2>What is Letter Spacing?</h2>

      <p>Letter spacing, or tracking, is a part of typography. Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to
        make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. Besides letter-spacing (tracking), type
        arrangement involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing, and kerning.

      <h3>Why Use Letter Spacing?</h3>

      <p>Use letter spacing to effect text legibility. Tight letter-spacing, especially in small-sized text, can reduce
        readability. Adding white space around characters enables individual characters to be recognized more quickly by
        the eye. Too much space, however, can detach letters making it harder for readers to recognize whole words and
        phrases, thus also diminishing readability.

      <h3>How to Use Letter Spacing</h3>

      <p>Using font-relative values is recommended, so that the letter-spacing increases or decreases appropriately when
        the font-size is changed, either by design or by user behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important point to note when using letter-spacing is that the value specified does not change the
        default â€” it is added to the default spacing the browser applies (based on the font metrics). letter-spacing
        also supports negative values, which will tighten the appearance of text, rather than loosening it.

      <h2>What is Word Spacing?</h2>
      <p>The word-spacing property is similar to letter-spacing, though naturally its changes the amount of space
        between the words in a piece of text, not the individual characters.

      <h3>Accessibility Concerns</h3>
      <p>FA large positive or negative word-spacing value will make the sentences the styling is applied to unreadable.
        For text styled with a very large positive value, the words will be so far apart that it will no longer appear
        to be a sentence. For text styled with a large negative value, the words will overlap each other to the point
        where the beginning and end of each word is unrecognizable.

      <h3>Not Just Words</h3>
      <p>
        word-spacing affects inline-block elements as well as inline elements. In this example, several such elements
        are spaced by setting the word-spacing of their parent container:
